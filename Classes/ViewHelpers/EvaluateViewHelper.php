/**
 * This class is a Expressions view helper for the Fluid templating engine. 
 *
 * In TypoScript templates there exists a function called “getText”, which makes it possible
 * to retrieve values from a great number of sources (GET/POST, TSFE, rootline, etc.). 
 * Extension "expressions" provides a library which aims to reproduce this capability, 
 * so that it can be used by developers where Typoscript is not used for whatever reasons.
 *
 * Like for the TypoScript function, an expression – at a minimum – is comprised of a key, a colon (:) and a value. 
 * Example: tsfe:id
 * 
 * Expression keys reference:
 * 
 * tsfe:      get a value from the $TSFE global variable
 * page:      get a value related to the current page, as stored in $TSFE->page
 * config:    get a value from the “config” object, as stored in $TSFE->config['config']
 * plugin:    get a TypoScript property for a plugin as stored in $GLOBALS['TSFE']->tmpl->setup['plugin.'].
 * gp:        get a value from either the $_GET or $_POST superglobal arrays
 * vars:      get a value from "internal" variables.
 * extra:     see documentation
 * date:      get values related to the current time, using formats from the PHP date() function.
 * strtotime: get a timestamp by interpreting a human-readable date.
 * session:   get values from some structure stored in the temporary session
 * fe_user:   get values from FE User
 *
 * More documentation can be found at
 * http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/expressions/current/
